WIP implementation of `ASDF
<https://asdf-standard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ in C++.

This library currently depends on a fork of ``yaml-cpp``, which can be found
at `<https://github.com/drdavella/yaml-cpp>`. We hope that the changes in this
fork will eventually be merged into the upstream ``yaml-cpp`` repository (see
`<https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp/pull/585>`).
